When COVID-19 started, some individuals posted on social media platforms such as Reddit about various things related to COVID-19 such as the symptoms of COVID-19. In this assignment, you will be using your Python skills to investigate and gain insights about what users are posting about on a COVID-19 online forum. You will be given seven (7 ) files with data from a COVID-19 online forum. The data set contains posts published in a week i.e each file contains posts published each day for a week. These files contain data such as user names, posts published by these users, and dates, for example. In this assignment, you will work on several tasks; the goal of these tasks will be to gain insights about what users are posting about. Below are the  tasks:



Task 1: (a) Read the file and count the number of users who published posts

        (b) For each user who published a post, print out the user names of those who published 2 or more posts

        (c) print out the posts that mention the following symptoms: (i) cough, (ii) cold, (iii) fever



Task 2: Read all the 7 files and perform (a), (b), and (c) from Task 1 on all 7 files.



Task 3: From task 2, can you answer the following questions:

(a) over the course of the week,  was there an increase in the number of users who published posts?
